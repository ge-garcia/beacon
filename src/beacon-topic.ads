--  Beacon.Topic: one instantiation for each message type.
--
--     package Telemetry_Topic is new Beacon.Topic
--       (Message_Type => Telemetry_Reading, Queue_Depth => 32);
--
--  A publisher sends only Message_Type values, and a subscriber receives
--  only Message_Type values. No other path exists (design rule 1).
--
--  Static model (design rule 4): each instantiation has a fixed table of
--  Max_Subscribers entries. Rules for the user:
--    * Register each subscriber at startup, before the first Publish.
--    * Register from one task only. Registration is not task-safe.
--  After registration, Publish, Receive and the queries are task-safe.
--
--  Single writer: each instantiation has one Publisher. Create_Publisher
--  refuses a second one.
--
--  Runtime: this package needs protected types with entries. Use a
--  light-tasking (Ravenscar or Jorvik) or full runtime. A ZFP runtime
--  cannot host this package; use Beacon.Queue directly on ZFP.
